Plan out your program in a UML-like fashion.  Jink allows you to go "into" any node on the graph by zooming into it with the mouse-wheel.  Once inside the node, you can make an entirely new graph.  This is like adding a 3rd dimension to the canvas.

Note: _Jink can be used for planning out other things besides programs.  It can be used to formulate any grand ideas that may be dwelling in your head!_

Features:
  * export as source code so that you'll have a full template for your project.
  * smoothly navigate into and out of nodes.
  * some special nodes like Links and Media
