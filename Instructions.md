# Instructions #

## Creating a Graph ##
  * Click on the type of node you want to add from the upper-right corner.  Then click where you want to place the node.
  * To add a link between two nodes, left-click and drag from one node to another.
  * To remove all links from a node, middle-click that node.
  * To move a node, right-click on it and drag.
  * To resize a node, click on it and then drag one of the handles on the edge of the node.


## Navigating the Graph ##
  * To scroll, use the arrow keys (or WASD).
  * To zoom in and out, use the mouse wheel.
  * To create a new graph inside an existing node, zoom into it.
  * If you are inside one of your nodes, zoom far out to go up to the previous level.
  * To 'activate' a node, double-click it.  The effect is based on the type of node.  The default behavior is that you will zoom into that node.
  * You can also move up in depth by clicking on the stack in the bottom-right corner.
